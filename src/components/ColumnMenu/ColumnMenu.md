# Column menu

## Usage
In this menu you can define a tree structure to form a menu. Each menu item consists out of at least an ID (used to navigate) and a text (shown in the menu). Each item can also have children (the menu item will automatically become clickable and the menu will change from parent with child to the child with grandchildren items).

The menu will respond to an click event and sends the item to a parent component.
