# Date time slider

## Usage
This Date time slider lets the user slide to through an array of defined times. The current time is displayed on the left. The slider itself can be used to manually change the time. The buttons on the right can be used to loop over the times by pressing play, or with the forward and backward button you can manually go back and forward a timestep.
